00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,340
<v ->Welcome to the first section</v>

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,270
in this complete Node.js bootcamp.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,630
And in this section,

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,800
we will take our very first steps with Node.js

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,073
and its core modules by building a small and fun project.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,870
So my goal with the section

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,220
is to get you writing Nodes.js code as fast as possible,

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,970
but without worrying too much about how everything works

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,430
behind the scenes,

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,193
because that will follow in later sections.

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,430
So we will start using a lot of new concepts

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,210
all at the same time here,

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,090
and so don't worry, if you don't understand

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,580
all the technical details right away.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,103
That's just completely normal, all right?

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,332
Anyway, let's now get started on this journey.

18
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,499
