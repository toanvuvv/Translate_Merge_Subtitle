1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,890
<v Instructor>Let's keep moving</v>

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,443
and explore Node.js some more.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,050
And so let's now actually start a new JavaScript file.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,050
So right in the root folder, and I'm calling it index.js,

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,253
let's just decrease the terminal here a little bit.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,750
Okay, so let's now write our very first Node code

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,180
here inside a file and all I'm gonna do

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,897
is to create a hello variable.

9
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,980
(typing)

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:37,260
And then putting the classic "Hello world" in there.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,930
So "Hello world" has been traditionally used

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,330
when starting a new programming language

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,380
and that's kind of what we're doing here.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,630
Okay, and now I'm logging to the console

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,630
this hello variable, so very very very simple stuff.

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,400
Give it a save and let's actually now run this file.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,070
So, in normal JavaScript in a browser,

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,040
we would now include this JavaScript file

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,760
into some HTML file and then open up

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,350
that HTML file in a browser, right?

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,060
But here with Node, we don't need to do anything like that.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,793
All we do is to use our Node command.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,430
But now, we're not gonna hit 'Enter' right away,

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,600
because that would take us back to the REPL

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,577
but instead we want to run this file.

26
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:30,240
And so all we have to do is to write Node

27
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,610
and then the name of the file, so index.js,

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,610
hit 'Enter' and indeed, here we have our log "Hello world."

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,670
So congratulations, you just ran

30
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,710
your very first Node script.

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,210
Now, that isn't really all that useful, is it?

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,930
So let's do something a bit more advanced.

33
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,630
And remember how I said right in the first lecture

34
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,670
that with Node.js, we can do all kinds of amazing things

35
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,800
that we cannot do with JavaScript in the browser

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,330
like for example reading files from the file system, right?

37
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,690
Now in order to do that, we need to use a Node module.

38
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,790
So Node.js is really built around this concept of modules

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,470
where all kinds of additional functionality

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,060
are stored in a module.

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,340
And in the case for reading files,

42
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,740
that is inside the FS module.

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,050
So how do we open up these modules,

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,810
or how can we actually use them?

45
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,810
Well, we do require them into our code and then store

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,140
the result of the requiring function in a variable.

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,383
So that sounds a bit complicated, so let's simply do it.

48
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,443
So we will call FS to the result

49
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,170
(typing)

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,580
of requiring the FS module.

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,720
And FS here stands for file system.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,870
So by using this module here, we will get access

53
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,900
to functions for reading data and writing data

54
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,570
right to the file system.

55
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,670
So again, calling this function here with this built-in

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,850
FS module name will then return an object

57
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,640
in which there are lots of functions that we can use.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,230
And restore that object right into the FS variable

59
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,500
that we can then later use.

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
We are going to use it in the next video,

61
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,310
but for now I want to quickly take a look

62
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,510
at the Node documentation with you,

63
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,450
so that in case you need some other module

64
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,900
for yourself later, you always know where

65
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,050
to look up some information about it.

66
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,410
Okay, so the Node documentations are something really,

67
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,033
really important for every Node developer to know about.

68
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,080
So, what we do is to go to nodejs.org

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,660
and then hit the documentations tab here

70
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,150
and then select the Node version that you're using

71
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,760
here on the left side.

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,460
So I am using version 10, and so

73
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,710
that's the one I'm choosing here.

74
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,220
And so that is the documentation.

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,490
Here on the left side, you have all kinds

76
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,163
of different modules.

77
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,090
For example, you have the REPL as well,

78
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,820
so the REPL is what we used in the last lecture

79
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,450
and if you need to know a bit more about it,

80
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,240
well you can come down here and read

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,410
whatever you need to know.

82
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,310
For example, the exit that I talked about

83
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,913
is documented here and well, all kinds of stuff.

84
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay, you can also actually use the REPL

85
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,350
inside your code, which doesn't make much sense

86
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,883
but is actually possible.

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,150
So again all the modules are listed here on the left side

88
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,943
and the one that we just implemented is the file system.

89
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,660
Okay, and so down here you have all this different stuff

90
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,410
that for now will not make much sense to you, okay,

91
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,130
but that's no problem at all.

92
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,420
That's why we have this whole course ahead of us.

93
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,870
For now just know that in case you need anything,

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,660
it is always available in the documentation for you.

95
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,600
So for example, in the next video,

96
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
we will read a file from the disk to our code.

97
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,423
And we're gonna do that using the read file sync.

98
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,380
And so here you have all the information

99
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,850
about that specific function.

100
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,160
Okay, and so in the next video,

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,790
that is actually what we're gonna do.

102
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,040
And in this one, you learned how to write

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,470
your own very first Node code inside

104
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,900
of a new JavaScript file, and then run

105
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,440
that file in the terminal.

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,220
Then we also required the file system module

107
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,490
and so, again, in the next video,

108
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,460
we will finally use it and import some files.

109
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,293
See you then.
